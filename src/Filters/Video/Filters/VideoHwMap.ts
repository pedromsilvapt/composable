/**
  * 11.97 hwmap
  * Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.
  * 
  * This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends on the input and output formats:
  * 
  * 
  * Hardware frame input, normal frame output
  * 
  * Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output. If the original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying something else on part of it), the hwmap filter can be used again in the next mode to retrieve it.
  * 
  * 
  * Normal frame input, hardware frame output
  * 
  * If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it - that is, return the original hardware frame.
  * 
  * Otherwise, a device must be provided. Create new hardware surfaces on that device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input and give those frames to the preceding filter. This will then act like the
  * hwupload filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when the input is already in a compatible format.
  * 
  * 
  * Hardware frame input and output
  * 
  * A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the
  * derive_device option. The input and output devices must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).
  * 
  * If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap to retrieve the original frames.
  * 
  * Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames on the output corresponding to the frames on the input.

  * The following additional parameters are accepted:
